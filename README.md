# -Bank_-Loan-Analysis
1. Background and Overview
The financial services industry heavily relies on loan data analysis to track business performance, mitigate risk, and improve decision-making.
In this project, we analyze a dataset of 38,576 loan records (24 attributes) to evaluate lending activities, repayment patterns, borrower profiles, and key financial health indicators.
The objective is to build actionable KPIs and visualizations that allow stakeholders (banks, NBFCs, fintech companies) to:
•	Track loan applications and repayments in real time.
•	Monitor borrower risk through DTI (Debt-to-Income) and interest rates.
•	Identify trends by geography, loan purpose, employment history, and home ownership.
•	Separate good loans from bad loans to evaluate portfolio quality.
2.Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) Requirements:
Total Loan Applications: We need to calculate the total number of loan applications received during a specified period. Additionally, it is essential to monitor the Month-to-Date (MTD) Loan Applications.
Total Funded Amount: Understanding the total amount of funds disbursed as loans is crucial. We also want to keep an eye on the MTD Total Funded Amount metric.
Total Amount Received: Tracking the total amount received from borrowers is essential for assessing the bank's cash flow and loan repayment. We should analyse the Month-to-Date (MTD) Total Amount Receive.
Average Interest Rate: Calculating the average interest rate across all loans which will provide insights into our lending portfolio's overall cost.
Average Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI): Evaluating the average DTI for our borrowers helps us gauge their financial health. We need to compute the average DTI for all loans.
